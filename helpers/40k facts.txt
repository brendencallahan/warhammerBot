*Imperium:


* The Emperor created 20 genetically enhanced children to lead his conquest of the galaxy. These children became the Primarchs, and are the basis of all space marines.
* As babies, the Primarchs were kidnapped by demons and scattered across the galaxy. They grew up completely separately from each other and the Imperium, only being reunited years later. Two Primarchs are still missing.
* Each primarch served as the genetic basis for their own legion of space marines. These original legions in turn are the basis of all subsequent chapters. All living space marines contain the grafted DNA of a primarch.
* In the year 30,000, the primarch Horus Lupercal betrayed the Imperium and started a massive civil war. This is known as the Horus Heresy and resulted in the deaths of the Emperor, most of the primarchs, and Horus himself.
* Of the 20 Primarchs, only 9 remained loyal to the emperor during the heresy. Of those, only one (Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines) is still alive.
* While Horus, primarch of the Sons of Horus and leader of the Heresy, is dead, several traitor primarchs remain active including Angron of the World Eaters, Mortarian of the Death Guard, and Magnus the Red of The Thousand Sons.
* The Ultramarines are led by Roboute Guilliman and are the most strict, rule-abiding chapter. They follow the Codex Astartes (a guide on how to be a good space marine written by RB) to the letter.
* Roboute Guilliman (whose difficult to pronounce roman-esque name is often intentionally comically mispronounced in fandom spaces) was raised on the Roman-inspired world of Macragge by the consol Konor Guilliman who instructed him in both war and statecraft. Fearing the power of this new adopted son, the other consols of Macragge conspired and murdered Konor, leading Rowboat Gorillaman to wage a bloody campaign of revenge in the months leading to his rediscovery by the Emperor. When writing the Codex Astartes, Robot Ghilliesuit would cite this incident as precedent why the rules that governed space marines should be absolute and binding.
* Space Marines have 22 extra organs implanted in them during the transition process, including an additional heart, 2 extra sets of lungs, and another kidney. The implantation process takes roughly 6-8 years. Scientifically Space Marines are mutants, but that’s heresy, so the Imperium refers to them as Transhumans.
* The Iron Hands were led by Ferrus Manus (hey that’s me!) and are renowned for their skill in manufacturing and cybernetics. In the time since the Heresy, they’ve become reclusive and distrustful of their fellow space marines, rarely engaging with anyone outside their chapter except when absolutely necessary.
* Ferrus Manus (hey that’s me!) was raised on the savage world of Medusa, and much of his youth is shrouded in mystery. He gained a reputation for harsh leadership, uniting the disparate human clans of the planet under his rule and boldly propelling them into a more technically advanced society through his experimentation with abandoned old world tech buried deep in the planet’s ice. Ferrus’ most unique feature were his hands, which were coated in a layer of the ancient metal necrodermis and allowed him to freely shape other metals without need of heat or tools. Ferrus Manus died during the Heresy, struck down by the traitor primarch Fulgrim.
* The Blood Angels were led by Sanguinius and are one of the most recognized and celebrated chapters in the Imperium. Sanguinius himself was oft described as the Emperor’s favorite son, and the Blood Angels strive to present as noble, heroic defenders of humanity. Unfortunately, secret to all but the highest ranking officers, their gene seed is corrupted by an unnatural craving to consume human blood. The Red Thirst as it is known within the chapter is a great source of shame, and the Blood Angels are quick to silence anyone who might share knowledge of it with the larger Imperium. (Also suggesting that any space marine, let alone E’s favorite chapter, could possibly be flawed is top-tier heresy and a great way to earn yourself a swift execution.)
* Sanguinius was raised on the deathworld of Baal Secundus by the warlike roving tribes that called the planet home. Touched by mutation at a young age, Sanguinius bore a pair of angel-like wings that he had full facility of and used as both a source of mobility and inspiration when later leading his chapter into battle. Wings were not his only mutation however, as unknown to any but his closest compatriot the angel primarch also had an unnatural craving for human blood, a compulsion he passed down to his chapter. Sanguinius died during the Heresy, struck down by Horus himself while defending the Emperor, but also wounding Horus enough to prevent his victory and the collapse of the Imperium.
* The Dark Angels were led by Lion El’Jonson and are the the most secretive and esoteric of all space marine chapters. They do not follow the Codex Astartes, instead abiding by their own much stricter and archaic set of laws, and pursue a never ending goal of atoning for what they see as a horrible sin they inflicted upon the Imperium during the Horus Heresy. During the Heresy, the chapter split in a brutal inter-chapter war that resulted in the destruction of their home planet, Caliban, and many Dark Angels succumbed to chaos and escaped into the warp. As the only chapter of split allegiance (with all others either remaining loyal or fully turning) the Dark Angels see it as their solemn duty to personally kill any and all of their fallen brethren.
* Lion El’Jonson was raised on the deathworld of Caliban, which was under constant threat by massive mutated monsters known as “Great Beasts.” The planet itself had regressed to a feudal system of government while still maintaining a high level of technological advancement, and Lion quickly grew his reputation by taking on expeditions to slay Great Beasts in order to protect his adopted world. Lion died during the Dark Angels inter-chapter war which also resulted in the destruction of Caliban due to warp interference. (Imagine trying to pull the crust of a planet through its own core like someone tying their shoes and you’ve basically got the idea.)
* Surprise! Lion El’Jonson isn’t actually dead! While officially he perished at the fall of Caliban, in actuality he’s comatose on The Rock, a mobile space station and the Dark Angel’s current base of operations. While his body is healed, his coma persists, and many Dark Angels believe he’ll only awake once all of the traitor Dark Angels are finally slain.


*Chaos:


* There are 4 chaos gods: Nurgle the god of Life and Disease; Khorne the god of violence and glory; Tzeentch the god of knowledge and treachery; and Slaanesh the god of excess.
* Each god has at least one primarch-led  traitor legion of space marines sworn to their service. Death Guard for Nurgle, World Eaters for Khorne, Thousand Sons for Tzeentch, and Emperor’s Children for Slaanesh.
* Chaos inhabits and is native to the Warp, a plane of pure psychic energy created and empowered by emotion. In the past the warp was a largely neutral space, but violence and hate have become such a dominant force in the 41st millennium that now it’s utterly hostile.
* Residents of the Warp are known as demons and they can appear anywhere the warp intersects with reality. There are some places where such portals exist naturally, but they can also be artificially opened with the use of technology or psychic power.
* Demons are often (though not always) aligned to one of the chaos gods. Being made of pure psychic energy, demons can be extremely different from one another even within godly affiliation.
* Rarely, mortals may “ascend” and become demons by allowing their bodies to be deconstructed into pure psychic energy. Most mortals who ascend this way become chaos spawn, mindless instinct driven mutants, but rarely they may end up as demon princes who retain control of their minds.


*Xenos (aliens):


* The ork word for shooting is “Dakka” and much of ork philosophy is driven by a desire for “more dakka.” Often Orks will pick their weapons largely based on how fast it shoots, rather than if it’s accurate. The melee equivalent of Dakka is choppa.
* Orks project a weak psychic field that’s useless to individual Orks but can warp reality subtlety when enough of them are gathered. With enough Orks gathered together, vehicles painted red will be faster than identical counterparts and munitions painted yellow will result in larger explosions (and vice-versa) purely due to the combined belief of the assembled Orks that that should be the case.
* In extreme cases, ork vehicles and weapons may even continue to function after using up all their fuel/ammunition because (since no one checked) the Orks still believe they’re fine. There’s at least one recorded instance of an ork shooting a guardsman to death with what (upon further inspection) turned out to be a broom handle because the ork reached for it and fired before realizing his mistake (and was under the presence of an incredibly powerful ork gestalt field. This is not a thing Orks can do all the time.)
* While orks don’t have a strong sense of loyalty by any means, many in the modern era have chosen to follow Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, the self-proclaimed Beast of Armageddon. He claims to hear the voices of the ork gods, Gork and Mork, and follows their commands in his pursuit of larger and wilder fights.
* The Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka has only ever spared one enemy, the Imperium Commissar Sebastian Yarrick. After Yarrick repelled three different invasions by Thraka, the Warlord declared him his “personal rival” and has declared that no ork may kill him so that they may continue to butt heads as equals. When Thraka’s fourth invasion succeeded, only Yarrick was allowed to leave the planet alive, being personally escorted off-world by Thraka himself.
* The only known instance of time travel in the 40k setting occurred when a warband of orks unwittingly disrupted warp travel with their own latent psychic field and ended up arriving back at their original destination several minutes before their original departure. Never one to miss an opportunity to seize a trophy, their leader Grizgutz promptly murdered his past self in order to acquire a copy of his favorite gun. This did not cause a timeline shattering paradox because none of the orks present realized it should.
* Tuska Daemon-Killa is an ork warlord who, appropriately, earned his name through a unique love of fighting demons. At some point in the past, this love drove him to strand himself and his warband in the warp where there was an endless supply of demons for them to fight. Khorne, the god of violence, found this so amusing that he forcefully reallocated the orks to his domain and now personally resurrects them whenever they fall in battle, ensuring that there’s always a bloody conflict on his doorstep. Tuska, for his part, couldn’t be happier.
* Tyrannids (often shortened to “Nids”) are a race of intergalactic insectoids who seek only to amass more and more biomatter. To this end the invade planets teeming with life and strip them bare, consuming all organic matter and converting it to more Tyrannids.
